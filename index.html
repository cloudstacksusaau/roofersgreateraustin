	<p>
	For most roof repair needs, you will find that the cost of the repair (or replacement) varies depending on what exactly is damaged. One of the first things that you will notice is how different the damages are if it is an old home or if it is a newly built one. If the damage is caused by external factors such as heavy rain, then there may be different types of damages that will need to be addressed.

	The inspection and testing requirements for various types of repairs are different depending on the building in question. Most commercial buildings are required by law to have a periodic inspection performed by a certified roofing specialist in Austin. These specialists will give you an inspection report once the repairs have been completed. You can take these reports with you when you go to the city inspector for the review process.

	It is a wise idea to have your roof inspected at least once a year. During a full-season inspection, you will find the following problems: loose shingles, missing or cracked shingles, missing valleys, missing protrusions, missing tiles, flaking paint, and weak flashings. Prevent these problems from occurring by scheduling an inspection.
